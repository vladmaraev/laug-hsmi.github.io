### About the workshop

LaugHSMI (Laughter, Humour, Smiles in Multimodal Interactions) is a workshop dedicated to advancing research on the role of laughter, smiles, and humor in human-computer interaction and multimodal communication. These phenomena are fundamental aspects of human social interaction, yet they remain challenging to detect, interpret, and generate in computational systems.

Laughter and smiling serve multiple communicative functions beyond expressing amusement—they facilitate social bonding, regulate conversation flow, signal understanding, and convey complex emotional states. Humor adds another layer of complexity, involving cognitive, linguistic, and cultural dimensions. Understanding and modeling these phenomena is crucial for creating more natural, engaging, and socially intelligent interactive systems.

This workshop brings together researchers from affective computing, natural language processing, computer vision, speech processing, human-computer interaction, and social signal processing to address the unique challenges posed by laughter, smiles, and humor in multimodal interactions. We aim to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and advance the state-of-the-art in detecting, analyzing, and generating these important social signals.

<h3 id="call-for-submissions">Call for submissions</h3>

We invite submissions on the following topics:

* **Detection and Analysis:**
  - Automatic detection of laughter, smiles, and humor in multimodal data
  - Acoustic, visual, and linguistic features of laughter and smiling
  - Temporal dynamics and synchronization of laughter in conversations
  - Cross-cultural variations in laughter, smiling, and humor expression
  - Spontaneous vs. posed laughter and smiles

* **Understanding and Modeling:**
  - Computational models of humor comprehension and generation
  - Functions of laughter in social interaction and conversation management
  - Emotional and pragmatic aspects of laughter and smiling
  - Multimodal fusion approaches for laughter and smile recognition
  - Deep learning and transformer-based models for humor and laughter

* **Applications:**
  - Laughter and humor in human-agent and human-robot interaction
  - Affective dialogue systems incorporating laughter and humor
  - Therapeutic applications: laughter yoga, humor therapy
  - Entertainment and gaming applications
  - Social robotics and embodied conversational agents
  - Detection of genuine vs. social laughter in mental health assessment

* **Datasets and Evaluation:**
  - Corpora and datasets of natural laughter, smiles, and humor
  - Annotation schemes and inter-rater reliability challenges
  - Evaluation metrics for laughter detection and humor generation
  - Ethical considerations in laughter and humor research

<h3 id="submissions">Submission process</h3>

Submission to the LaugHSMI workshop is **double-blind**. The workshop accepts short research papers (4 pages, excluding references) and full-length papers (8 pages, excluding references). Authors are required to follow standard [ACM ICMI paper format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Short research papers can describe work in progress, position papers, datasets, or research papers that have been already published in another venue (conference or journal) in the last 12 months that are relevant to LaugHSMI's topics of interest. For already published works, please submit a summarized four-page short paper.

All submissions should be submitted through OpenReview before the deadline (see important dates below).

All submissions will be reviewed by at least two non-conflicting reviewers. All papers will be presented during a dedicated poster session. Selected full-length and short papers will also be presented as oral presentations throughout the day.

It is expected that at least one author of each accepted paper will register for the workshop and present the work during the event. Online presentations will be considered for presenters who cannot attend in person due to visa or personal constraints.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact the organizers (see contacts below).
